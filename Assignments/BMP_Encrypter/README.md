"BMP_Encrypter" : C++ program that Encrypts various files(read in binary) into '.bmp' files.

it was written by myself, with not much reference except 'BMP header specification in Wikipedia'

this was a part of assignment for 'Data-Structure Clas, 2017, HS2' . And I chose this because I was interested in Steganography.

Code is bit dirty. I didn't have clear understanding of 'class' and stuff back then. Also, this code contains alot of functions

just to Handle 'character arrays!! ( char [] )' . So.... whatever, it works.

It can be directly executed through './BMP_Encrypter_Release/Release' folder's .exe file. 

<Main Features>

1) You can 'DRAG and DROP' your target files (which I think is the most convenient feature of my program) . Which will then be cached by

the program itself into '../DATA/NO_OPEN_storage/' ... 

2) Has cool Loading & Welcone & Help page. Read from seperate txt file from '../DATA/NO_OPEN_storage/Graphic.txt'

3) You can encode 'ANY type of Binary File' into any BMP image. But image should be some order biger than the file being encrypted.

4) I've built pretty useful Main-Page inside the program. So executing and playing with it should be Straightforward.
