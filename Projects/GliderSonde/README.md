This is a project I've done for Korea's Science Fair.

The Goal was making 'Radiosonde that could return to the Launch Point by Itself by conbining GLIDER and RADIOSONDE into one.'

I coded alot from [End of 2016 ~ Start of 2017]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first taught myself about Arduino at around July of 2016.

I mostly got lesson from alot of 'real-world applications of Arduino' which includes

"Joop Brokking's YMFC-quadcopter Series(http://www.brokking.net/ymfc-3d_main.html)".

=> That Series really gave me an Insight of what amazing job Arduino-UNO can do!!

I got alot of inspiration from these guys : 

1) Joop Brokking(https://www.youtube.com/user/MacPuffdog)

2) iforce2d(https://www.youtube.com/user/iforce2d)

* Above 2 people were the Key to my learning process about Arduino.

Without them, I wouldn't have been able to

1) get an insight of how PID-controlled Quadcopter Works & How PIN_CHANGE_INTERRUPT can be utilized to read PWM signals from Receiver

2) use UBLOX-GPS protocol so easily(great code he worked on!) & get a chance to know about iNAV & nRF24l01 radio chips 

and many more......

I THANK these two guys for opening up their projects, and putting alot of effort into making quality Videos. So that it can help thousands of other People!!
