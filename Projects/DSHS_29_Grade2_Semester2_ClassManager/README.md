Started at around 2017, February.
Not complete. This was an attempt to make Automated-Program
to allocate School's schedule based on all the student's 
survery-kind of thing that's done Every Semester...

Couldn't progress much on this one...
I remember being pissed off at processing data this size, complicated.
[I probably oversaw the simple way, which I kind of got to konw about at around 2017, November
when friend of mine tried to use Genetic-Algorithm to solve the Same problem. The differece is that
he/his friend haved skipped the part that I was not able to finish using EXCEL! it was brilliant.
They just made a list of students for each class. Well, that is much simpler. And they really allocated
Day-of-Week & Time-of-Day for each classes, it is amazing!]
