1) CPP version - written back in 2017 May ~ July.

Very not-flexible, you have to type every single file's name on the console you want to Encrypt.

2) Python version - written on January 22th 2018(Monday).

Very flexible. You can select Any Directory you want to Encrypt. And the program allows to encrypt

'whole' directory (which means, including ALL the sub-directories) to be Encrypted and copied to some other directory.

If you want, you can just encrypt not All, but only files right under the directory you wanted by typing 'N' for Recursive-option Question!

**Warning** : This program reads all the Binary data at once. So if you try to Encrypt Big files (over 100MB or so), program Will Probably Crash.
