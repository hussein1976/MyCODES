Simple 'Bitwise Inverting' Encryption Software

<b>1) Python version - written on January 22th 2018(Monday)
- You can select Any Directory you want to Encrypt.
- Whole sub-directory and files inside the selected Directory can be Encrypted (Recursive Option)
- If you want, you can just encrypt not All, but only files right under the directory (Non-recursive Option)

**Warning** : This program reads all the Binary data at once. So if you try to Encrypt Big files (over 100MB or so), program Will Probably Crash.

2) CPP version - written back in 2017 May ~ July.

Very not-flexible, you have to type every single file's name on the console you want to Encrypt.
