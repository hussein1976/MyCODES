<Things I learned>

1) Use 'bytearray' class for Writing in Binary-File.
2) os.path.dirname(str) Doesn't access that file to Check it. It only works internally, with only information given with 'str'.
3) So, os.path.dirname('./Hello/Dir') WILL BE './Hello' . So to EXTRACT directory name, Check if the give nstr is FileName or not!!!

4) os.path.join(a,b) : When b Starts with '\', then the Function Freaks Out, even when a doesn't have '\'. It will not give the result you want!

<What Program Does>

Encrypts File from One Place to Another using simple 'BitWise-inverting(~)' method.
With 'Drag-N-Drop', you can temporarily Encrypt All the File inside one Directory, including Sub-directories if you want.

Note that Since 2-times Encrypted Means Original, this Program will 'decrypt' the Encrypted file And 'encrypt' the Decrypted file.

Pretty Handy, if you want to hide some pictures / files from some folder with a lot of sub-directories, but small-size.

**WARNING : If you use this on directory with Big-Sized File(100Mb ?), open(str,'rb').read() function might BLOW-UP.
**I only use this for small-size file. Never with potentially big-files(Video, ZipFile)
